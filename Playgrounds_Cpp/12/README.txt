This was also a exercise on learncpp.com. My program was correct and it behaved in same manner as learncpp had expected. 

Although I initiallized the variables before "Enter three numbers" while learncpp had initialized the variables after "Enter three numbers".

And I did '\n' separately while learncpp did it along with the fullstop period like this ".\n".

Other wise my program gave same output.
